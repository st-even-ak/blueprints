ITG Document Plugins

This project creates a confluence plugin that guides user through the document creation process.

Currently it includes templates for:
- Briefs
- Change requests
- Release notes

Next Steps:
- Add Db connectivity so the Soy templates in the wizard can be dynamically driven
- Add configuration page(s) so Conf admins can manage the plugins with requiring rebuilds
